View a list here: https://ganderoceanic.com/training-system-support Accessing the new system To access the training administration system, go to myCZQO and click on the Instructing tab, or alternatively, the Dashboard button in the Staff tab. Dashboard The first page you will see upon entering the system is the Training Dashboard. This provides an overview of students ready for pick up and things assigned to you. If you're a Senior Staff member, it will also show pending applications. The sidebar on the left is a central navigation point for the system. The contents of it will change depending on your level of access. For example, people who are not Instructors or Assessors will not see \u201cYour Students\u201d and similar tabs. Primary Pages Students This page allows you to view all current and past students. For current students, their date of addition and status labels will appear. The Chief Instructor can also add a student or send a message to all students from this page via the links at the bottom. Instructors This page allows you to view all current Instructors and Assessors. It shows you the number of students assigned to them. As with students, the CI can add Instructors and send a message to all Instructors from here. This page does not show people who have previously been Instructors but are not currently. To access these Instructors, enter the following URL: /admin/training/instructing/instructors/CID Calendar To be added Board This page replicates what we currently have on Trello and allows for a full view of where students are assigned to. It lists students under the Not Ready, Ready For Pick-Up, Solo Cert, and Ready for Assessment labels in seperate lists, and then shows lists for each Instructor showing their assigned students. To add a list to the Board, a new Student Status Label needs to be created. Training/OTS Sessions To be added Your Students (add) Through the training process Student profiles To pick up a student marked as Ready for Pick-Up, access their profile via the Dashboard, the Board, or the Students page. You will be presented with their profile. Information Here you can find their contact details. This information is only shown if you are a Senior Staff member or the Instructor assigned to the student for privacy reasons. Availability Before a student is marked Ready For Pick-Up, they must submit their availability for training via myCZQO's Training Portal. They are notified of this when their application is accepted. (Marked in red) Instructor Here, you can view the instructor assigned to the student and assign you or another person as their Instructor. Pick up the student To pick up the student, click the Assign button in the Instructor panel. You will be presented with a dialog asking you to pick the Instructor you wish to assign. Choose yourself in the select box. Then click Assign. It will sent you an email confirmation and the student will now be assigned to you. You should also then be able to view their contact details. The student will now appear as assigned to you, and has they have been picked up, they will be assigned the In Progress label. You may now continue organising sessions with them via email or Discord as normal. In the future, you will be able to organise sessions through the website. Training sessions Coming soon. For now, continue as we have before and create Training Notes to document sessions. Training notes As their assigned Instructor, you can create Training Notes for your student documenting their process. Access their notes via the student profile. You can view the notes created previously for this Student. View them by clicking the View button on each. You can add a note by clicking the Add Note button. Below them, you can also view Recommendations given by Instructors for the student in the past. These include recommendations for OTS and Solo Certs. Training notes can be viewable by students (recommended) or limited to staff only. Status labels Students can be assigned status labels to show their current stage of training. They are: Not Ready - student has been accepted, still hasn't submitted their availability Ready For Pick-Up - student has submitted their times, or the student has not got an assigned instructor In Progress - student is assigned and training is underway Solo Certification - student has an active solo certification (assigned in conjunction with In Progress) Ready For Assessment - student is recommended by Instructor for assessment (assigned without In Progress) Completed - student has passed assessment and has completed training Inactive - student should be placed for removal To assign a label, click the plus icon next to their status labels on their profile. You will be presented with a dialog asking you to pick the label. To remove a label, hover over the label until you get a red mark next to it. Click the label to remove it. You cannot remove a label if it is the only one assigned to the student. Recommendations You can recommend your student be given a Solo Certification and be sent for assessment. These buttons are visible on their student profile. To issue a recommendation, click the respective button. It will send an email notification to all Assessors with your recommendation. They will communicate with you their course of action. These buttons will be greyed out if the student is already on a solo cert or is marked ready for assessment, respectively. Finishing their training When an Assessor has marked a student as having passed their OTS, they will need to create a training note with their assessment report. Eventually, this will be done through marking their OTS Session as Passed.","title":"Training admin guide"},{"location":"controller/","text":"Controller Konwledge Base Use the left hand nav menu to locate the knowledge you wish to view","title":"Controller"},{"location":"controller/#controller-konwledge-base","text":"Use the left hand nav menu to locate the knowledge you wish to view","title":"Controller Konwledge Base"},{"location":"controller/cpdlc/","text":"Prerequisites For the use of CPDLC on the network, one requires a Hoppies acars account.

Navigate to Tools > CPDLC > Current Messages A window like this will have appeared, you can interact with mesages by clicking on them. ACCEPT Means you will allow them to Logon, UNABLE Will deny the logon request. you may ocasionally get freetext messages that WILL let you respond to them here. clickiing REPLY will allow you to write free text in the box, and dictate what repsonse you're allowing the pilot to give. Eg. \"AFK approved, report back\" with \"Roger\" as a response. Don't forget to Archive messages once they are no longer needed to ensure you can maintain situational awareness. Logged on Aircraft Once an aircraft is logged on their callsign will have solid [] square brakets (as shown bellow). This means they are logged on to CPDLC and will recive every intruction you add to their tag, eg updating their mach or FL. In the event they logon to CPDLC before you copy their Mach and FL they will recive the \"maintain FLXYZ\" and \"Maintain Mach X.YZ\" via CPDLC and may be confused. Don't stress!! This can be prevented! with a CPDLC logged on aircraft, you will now see two options when selecting a mach/FL a R/T and CPDLC option. If you have discussed the change on freq and don't wish to send the pilot a CPDLC, click the R/T option. Which will allow you to change it silently. CPDLC Mach and FL instructions? Once you've sent a CPDLC instruction to climb/descend or change MACH a set for square brakets [] will appear around the info in Blue. Once the pilot responds with WILCO to the instruction, the brakets will go away. If the pilot says UNABLE the change will revert. In the event the pilot takes too long to respond the uplink will go brown on both tag and messages. Free text messages? Sadly unlike the pilots we're unable to send \"free text\" although we are teased with the idea. To send a \"free text\" message to inform the pilot of something, click on the tag callsign. [!NOTE] (aircraft has to already be logged onto CPDLC) Click the CPDLC Free Text option. which provide a series of suggested messages includind AFK, the only response to an oceanic request, and some unicom handoff statments...

[!NOTE] It is common for planes to not respond with a \"logoff\" statment when you log them off, so they will remain in the list. At the time of writing there is no known way to remove said aircraft.

Note all of these keybinds can be changed in Settings > Keyboard\u2026 Velocity Vectors This is the Line drawn from the aircraft in the direction of travel (suggest you set to 10 mins) Short Route Probe This is the line that follows the planed route based of a time/distance from the aircraft. I personally have it set to time > 10 and Default on History Trails Shows you previous refresh positions. By default is 4, controller preference. FPASD Flight Plan Air Situation Display. This is required to be on for all Oceanic controllers and is on by default. This allows you to to visualise positon reports with the square radar symbols Closest Approach tool Closest Approach tool displays the point at which two flight plan trajectories are closest. Select one track then use the keyboard (F1) and click the other to display closest approach trajectory. To clear a displayed closest approach, MIDDLE CLICK either, callsign, time label or distance.. Note Whilst surveillance data is used to update flight plan trajectories, this tool is not using current radar/ADSB data. Conflict Area Tool Conflict Area Tool determines the area that two flight plan routes are in lateral conflict. Select one track then use the keybind (F2) and click on the other. The drop down values are defined in the current profile and correspond to the required minimum lateral distance between the two routes. On successful calculation of a conflict area, the area with entry and exit times for both aircraft is displayed. To clear a displayed conflict area, MIDDLE CLICK either callsign time label at the entry/exit point. BRL tool Bearing and Range tool displays a bearing in degrees, from star to end. Reverse in the brackets, range in Nautical Miles, and a time to go in minutes when anchored on a track (radar return). Time to go is given as a 4 digit UTC time when one end is anchored to a track and the other is anchored to a point in space. backspace is used to start the BRL tool on your mouse position, left click can be used to place the other end. This example shows the ETH78 is flying 251 degrees M, and will reach 78.5nm at time 22:14z keybinds F9 Scratch Pad Scratchpads placeable anywhere on your radar screen. Can be moved with Right Click Numbpad + Numbpad plus can be used primarily as a time save, is used as the quickest method to open the handoff window. All that is required is to have the track or strip selected. To select the track just click on the radar symbol so that an octagon appears around it. To select the strip, click the callsign so there is a coloured highlight around the strip. Numbpad + will then quickly open the handoff menu Enter Similar to the above, Enter is the quick way to pickup a tag. Select the track or strip then simply hit enter and the tag is yours! View Point - Right Click Right Click can be used to set the precise location of where you want the view point. Start by right clicking where you want the center of your screen to show. Then, move out to select how large you want the area. View Point - MMB \u201cpeak\u201d You can move your view point around freely with middle mouse held down. This allows you to peak your view point somewhere until you let go returning it back to the previous location. Tag/track Highlight You can highlight a tag/track for your attention later my middle clicking the track symbol. Refuse or Hide a tag You can refuse or hide a tag having the track/strip selected and using the keybind SHIFT numb+ This can also be used to completely remove a FSPAD Mid Connection Sector Changing In the event you\u2019re controlling NAT_FFS and another controller wishes to logon Gander, when they connect the sectors/airspace associated with their connection will automatically remove from you. However should you wish to re-open to extend to the other sector. You can go to settings > Sectors\u2026 Sectors listed on the left are sectors you own, all the other sectors defined in the profile are listed on the right. Note that sectors not controllable by you are listed here. To pickup a sector, use one of the following options NATOC, SHANO, GANOC. Simply move the ones you want to the left and hit apply. This will manage all the little subsectors and transitional areas for you. Uncoupled flight plan? If a pilot enters your vis range or you connect and they are too far from their route their flight plan will be unable to couple as it is looking for them along their route. To resolve this you can use manual coupling. By locating the flight plan either in your strips (usually preactive) or by searching the flight plan Windows > Flight plan Select the track, and click couple on the flight plan to couple it to that track. This will then allow you to control it as normal (note you almost definitely will get a RAM as that is usually the reason it didn\u2019t couple in the first place) Decoupling a flight plan If for some reason you wish to decouple the flight plan, you can do so the same way, simply click decouple when you open the flight plan window.

Concorde aircraft undertake a \u2018cruise climb\u2019 at supersonic speeds. As fuel is burnt, Concorde aircraft are able to climb slowly as they become lighter, whilst maintaining a constant speed. This equates to a constant climb rate of approximately 50 feet per minute. All Concorde aircraft cruise climb from FL470-FL600 in the NAT HLA, therefore standard oceanic clearances for Concorde do not re-state this. This standard cruise climb is separated from all traffic operating at and below FL430. In the unlikely event that another, non-Concorde aircraft is transiting the OCA above FL430 on a conflicting route, it may be necessary to assign specific levels for cruise climb in the oceanic clearance to Concorde to ensure separation. Cruise climbing from FL490-600 is normally achievable, which ensures separation from traffic operating at and below FL450. Note: As the level clearance is a cruise climb, not a level block, lower levels will become progressively available to other traffic as the Concorde transits the OCA. 1.1.2 Lateral Separation - Concorde Tracks Four legacy tracks are utilised for the purpose of Concorde flights. Concorde tracks are named NAT SM, NAT SN, NAT SO & NAT SP. SM: \u201cSierra Mike\u201d for westbound flight only SN: \u201cSierra November\u201d for eastbound flight only SO: \u201cSierra Oscar\u201d overflow of supersonic traffic, as coordinated/cleared by ATC. SP: \u201cSierra Papa\u201d bi-directional route to Caribbean These tracks route via intermediate latitudes (i.e. degrees and minutes). For this reason, points on track are commonly abbreviated to the track name and their longitude. For example, Track SM is defined as the following points (with abbreviated names): 50\u00b0 41'N 15\u00b0W \u201cSierra Mike 15 West\u201d 50\u00b0 50'N 20\u00b0W \u201cSierra Mike 20 West\u201d etc. Figure 24 \u2013 Concorde Tracks Note: Supersonic flight on Concorde tracks is separated from flights via other Concorde tracks. 1.1.2.1 NAT-SM (Westbound) Waypoints SM15W (50.41N 15.00W), SM20W (50.50N 20.00W), SM30W (50.30N 30.00W), SM40W (49.16N 40.00W), SM50W (47.03N 50.00W), SM53W (46.10N 53.00W), SM60W (44.14N 60.00W), SM65W (42.46N 65.00W), SM67W (42.00N 67.00W) 1.1.2.2 NAT-SN (Eastbound) Waypoints SN67W (40.25N 67.00W), SN65W (41.40N 65.00W), SN60W (43.07N 60.00W), SN52W (45.10N 52.30W), SN50W (45.54N 50.00W), SN40W (48.10N 40.00W), SN30W (49.26N 30.00W), SN20W (49.49N 20.00W), SN15W (49.41N 15.00W) 1.1.2.3 NAT-SO (Alternate) Waypoints SO15W (48.40N 15.00W), SO20W (48.48N 20.00W), SO30W (48.22N 30.00W), SO40W (47.04N 40.00W), SO50W (44.45N 50.00W), SO52W (44.10N 52.00W), SO60W (42.00N 60.00W) 1.1.2.4 NAT-SP (Caribbean) Waypoints SP15W (48.49N 14.43W), SP20W (46.49N 20.00W), SP45N (45.00N 23.53W), SP30W (41.36N 30.00W), SP40W (34.22N 40.00W) 1.1.3 Longitudinal Separation Apply standard longitudinal separation minima for \u2018other aircraft\u2019 (non-ADS-B equipped). All Concorde aircraft operate a standard speed schedule on transatlantic routes, cruise climbing at approximately M2.00, meaningful deviation from this speed is not possible. Only Concorde aircraft operate on these tracks at the standard level block so it is not necessary to specify an assigned speed (Mach number) in the oceanic clearance. 1.1.4 London Heathrow (EGLL) Departures Oceanic clearance for Concorde aircraft departing London Heathrow (EGLL) on the standard oceanic Concorde tracks is coordinated by the controller covering the Heathrow Delivery function (when online). The Heathrow controller will pass the time estimate for 15W to the Shanwick Delivery controller (normally via text), who will pass back any time restrictions for 15W. If any delays occur whilst airborne, it is possible that the Concorde will not be able to reach its destination. This coordination method allows delays to be absorbed on the ground. Heathrow will manage the departure to ensure the aircraft can achieve any time restriction at 15W. Speaker Message EGLL_DEL BAW1, Concorde, Track SM, Estimating 15W at 1110. EGGX_DEL BAW1, Track SM, [no restrictions] / [cross 15W not before time 1119] / [cross 15W no later than time 1116] Note: It is advised that Shanwick does not pass a \u201cno later than\u201d time restriction to Heathrow, unless this time is at least 5 minutes after the original 15W estimate. This is to minimize the chance of unanticipated ground delays resulting in an airborne conflict. Note: Concorde aircraft that have been coordinated by Heathrow have received an oceanic clearance and are not required to obtain an oceanic clearance directly from Shanwick. The first direct contact with Shanwick will be at 15W for a position report. 1.2 Concorde Phraseology 1.2.1 Oceanic Clearance General Notes All Concorde aircraft entering the OCA require an oceanic clearance. Due to the standard speed profile and level block, only longitudinal separation against other Concorde aircraft needs to be considered. The Concorde phraseology is therefore succinct. The levels for a cruise climb are not normally stated. If required to ensure separation against other high-level traffic, append the cruise climb levels to the clearance example using the phraseology: \u201c\u2026cruise climb FL490-600\u201d. Concorde aircraft departing London Heathrow (EGLL) whose time estimate for 15W has been coordinated with Heathrow delivery are not required to contact Shanwick directly for an oceanic clearance.

All Concorde aircraft cruise climb from FL470-FL600 in the NAT HLA, therefore standard oceanic clearances for Concorde do not re-state this.

Figure 1 \u2013 Shanwick and Gander VHF Frequency Range at FL350 1.5.1 Oceanic Clearance Prior to Departure At some airfields proximate to the NAT HLA, an oceanic clearance is required prior to departure. On VATSIM, VHF coverage is assured at these airfields. Departure Point Jet Departures Non-Jet Departures EIDW, EIWT, EIME For all Oceanic entry points request when airborne.

All other aerodromes If the elapsed time to the Shanwick entry point is 40 minutes or less oceanic clearance is required prior to departure. 1.6 Selective Calling (SELCAL) Selective calling or SELCAL (pronounced \u201csell-call\u201d) is a method by which pilots may be notified that a controller wishes to contact them on the voice frequency. SELCAL works by the controller triggering a series of 4 audio tones to play over the HF frequency, which are then received by the SELCAL units onboard all the aircraft tuned to that frequency. If these tones correspond to the code assigned to a specific aircraft, a notification is relayed to the pilots. SELCAL therefore allows pilots to reduce the volume of the tuned HF frequency since in real life, HF transmissions are subject to significant background static that is both tiring and distracting to listen to over longer periods of time. On VATSIM, pilot clients act in the same way as SELCAL units - when a SELCAL that corresponds to the code the pilot entered when they logged into the network is received, it will generate an alert to the pilot. The function of the SELCAL system shall be checked on first contact with each Oceanic Controller. In EuroScope, controllers can trigger a SELCAL tone (e.g. EM-DG) by using: \u25aa \u201c.selcal emdg\u201d \u25aa \u201cSELCAL EM-DG\u201d \u25aa \u201c.selcal\u201d, then click on the aircraft","title":"Provision of Air Traffic Services"},{"location":"controller/sops/general/chap1/#provision-of-air-traffic-services","text":"CHAPTER 1","title":"Provision of Air Traffic Services"},{"location":"controller/sops/general/chap1/#11-roles-and-responsibilities","text":"\u25aa Provide the appropriate ATS within their stated AoR in order to ensure a safe, orderly and expeditious flow of air traffic. \u25aa Verify flight data including updating and managing the relevant datablock. \u25aa Maintain a listening watch and conduct standard radiotelephony communication with aircraft. \u25aa Provide ATS to aircraft using ADS-B derived surveillance data within their area of responsibility (AoR). \u25aa Provide assistance to aircraft in a state of emergency. \u25aa Coordinate the movement of aircraft into and out of the sector. \u25aa Issue clearances to aircraft to join, leave or cross regulated airspace. \u25aa When aircraft are accepted into the sector, ensure separation exists in accordance with this document. \u25aa Confirm all data transfer, revisions and estimates have been effected as required in local instructions.","title":"1.1 Roles and Responsibilities"},{"location":"controller/sops/general/chap1/#12-ats-surveillance-systems","text":"On VATSIM, ADS coverage is assumed throughout the Shanwick & Gander OCAs.

As such, an understanding of the separation requirements in this document will be sufficient for the purpose of oceanic control on VATSIM. Standard vertical or horizontal separation shall be provided between all flights in Class A airspace. At least one form of procedural separation must be maintained between all flights: \u25aa Vertical \u25aa Longitudinal \u25aa Lateral Note: \u201clongitudinal\u201d and \u201clateral\u201d refer to aircraft orientation, not the lines of longitude or latitude. The separation standards defined in this document are divided into two categories based on ADS-B equipage. In order to apply ADS-B based separation minima between two aircraft, both aircraft must be equipped with ADS-B. This requirement can be referred to with the phrase \u201csuitably equipped aircraft pairs\u201d. ADS-B does not allow controllers to assign headings to aircraft as they would in domestic, radarcontrolled airspace. It merely allows for more accurate monitoring of aircraft position. The only practical way to intervene in order to prevent a conflict at a late stage is to apply vertical separation. Note: Concorde Separation Rules are defined in Annex B - Concorde Procedures. 2.2 Vertical Separation Vertical separation exists when the vertical distance between aircraft is never less than the prescribed minimum. The vertical separation minima are: \u25aa Between aircraft flying subsonic: a. Up to FL290 apply 1000ft; b. Above FL290 apply 2000ft, except that between FL290 and FL410 inclusive, 1000ft may be applied between RVSM approved aircraft operating in airspace designated as being notified for the application of this separation standard. \u25aa Between aircraft flying supersonic and between aircraft flying supersonic and aircraft flying subsonic: a. Up to FL450 apply 2000ft; b. Above FL450 apply 4000ft. On VATSIM, all aircraft with an RFL above FL290 are assumed to be RVSM approved 2.2.1 Cruise Climbs and Level Blocks During cruise climbs and level blocks aircraft are considered to occupy all levels specified in the clearance, regardless of ADS or verbal level reports. In a cruise climb, aircraft may only climb, whereas level blocks allow aircraft to climb or descend to any level within the block. 2.3 Lateral Separation Lateral separation is established distance between the routes of two aircraft (note: this is not the distance between aircraft at any given point, but distance between any 2 points along 2 different routes). 2.3.1 Parallel or Non-Intersecting Tracks Parallel or non-intersecting tracks are deemed separated provided that they are spaced by at least: ADS-B Equipped Aircraft Pairs Other Aircraft Pairs 19 NM 60 NM or 1 degree (subject to gentle slope rules) If tracks are not deemed laterally separated then either longitudinal or vertical separation must be ensured Figure 2 \u2013 19NM Lateral Separation In Figure 2, aircraft A and B are laterally separated for the first portion of their route (green), however lateral separation does not exist once aircraft A\u2019s track deviates south. As soon as the first aircraft reaches the route portion that is no longer laterally separated, separation is lost. Therefore, another form of separation must be in place and separation ensured before this point is reached by either aircraft. 2.3.1.1 Gentle-Slope Rules Gentle slope rules are only relevant if one of the aircraft in the pair is not ADS-B equipped. Considering coordinates on a flat surface, parallel tracks separated by 1 degree would equate to 60NM. However, as the earth is spherical, the separation between parallel tracks actually falls to below 60NM. For this reason, the gentle-slope rules ensure separation never falls below 50.5NM. The gentle slope rules allow lateral separation to be defined in terms of degrees, rather than nautical miles. At different latitudes, slopes of different gradients may be deemed separated from each other. Tracks separated by 1 degree latitude are deemed separated from each other, provided that when travelling over 10 degrees longitude, the change in latitude of one of the tracks does not exceed: \u25aa 3 degrees at or South of 58N \u25aa 2 degrees between 58N and 70N \u25aa 1 degree at or North of 70N and South of 80N Example Two aircraft travel on parallel tracks. The table shows different possible parallel tracks travelling west over the next 10\u00b0 longitude (from 20W to 30W) \u2013 are the aircraft separated? Aircraft A Aircraft B Change in Latitude Allowable Maximum Separated? 5820N to 5830N 5920N to 5930N 0\u00b0 3\u00b0 Yes 5820N to 5530N 5920N to 5630N 3\u00b0 3\u00b0 Yes 5820N to 6130N 5920N to 6230N 3\u00b0 2\u00b0 No 6720N to 6930N 6820N to 7030N 2\u00b0 2\u00b0 Yes 6820N to 7030N 6920N to 7130N 2\u00b0 1\u00b0 No 2.3.2 Lateral Separation of OTS All co-directional tracks published in a NAT Track Message are laterally separated for ADS-B equipped aircraft pairs. Performance Based Communication Surveillance (PBCS) tracks are separated by less than one degree of latitude (0\u00b0 30\u2019 rather than 1\u00b0 degree). Aircraft that are not ADS-B equipped that are operating on PBCS tracks are not considered laterally separated from aircraft operating on adjacent PBCS tracks. It is therefore recommended (but not mandatory on VATSIM) to re-clear non-ADS-B equipped aircraft via non-PBCS tracks. As aircraft on VATSIM often fly tracks outside of the published times, conflicts between aircraft on opposite direction published tracks are possible. The \u2018Concorde Tracks\u2019 are also deemed laterally separated for all aircraft. 2.3.3 Strategic Lateral Offset Procedure (SLOP) The Strategic Lateral Offset Procedure allows pilots to deviate from their route up to 2 NM right of track at any increment of 0.1 NM, remaining parallel to the centreline. The purpose of the SLOP is to reduce wake turbulence encounters and also to reduce the chance of a collision when aircraft are required to conduct emergency descents or deviate from their cleared route/level. Pilots will not deviate until entering oceanic airspace and will re-join their cleared track before leaving. Aircraft conducting SLOP do not require a clearance to do so and are not required to inform the controlling agency. For the purposes of ensuring separation, the effect of SLOP is not required to be considered by controllers \u2013 this information is included here for reference only 2.4 Longitudinal Separation 2.4.1 Crossing Tracks Same Direction For aircraft operating on the same or intersecting tracks (tracks are not laterally separated) where the relative angle between the tracks is less than 90 degrees, aircraft must be longitudinally separated by: ADS-B Equipped Aircraft Pairs Other Aircraft Pairs 4 minutes at the oceanic entry point and 15 NM thereafter 10 minutes on the same track and 15 minutes on crossing tracks Note: 10 minutes separation may be reduced subject to the Mach Number Technique Figure 3 \u2013 Crossing Tracks (Same Direction) 2.4.1.1 Mach Number Technique (MNT) The Mach number technique is only relevant if one aircraft in the pair is not ADS-B equipped. Where turbojet aircraft flying a constant Mach number converge on the same point (which must be reported by both aircraft or confirmed by other means) and then proceed down the same track or diverging tracks, the 10 minutes longitudinal separation may be reduced if the following aircraft maintains a slower speed: Following Aircraft slower by Separation 0.01 Mach 10 minutes 0.02 Mach 9 minutes 0.03 Mach 8 minutes 0.04 Mach 7 minutes 0.05 Mach 6 minutes 0.06 Mach or more 5 minutes 2.4.2 Crossing Tracks Opposite Direction For aircraft operating on the same or intersecting tracks (i.e. tracks that are not laterally separated) where the relative angle between the tracks is between 90 and 180 degrees, longitudinal separation cannot be established throughout. Vertical separation must be established at least 15 minutes prior to the closest point of approach. Figure 4 \u2013 Crossing Tracks (Opposite Direction) Vertical separation is no longer required once both aircraft have passed each other by: ADS-B Equipped Aircraft Pairs Other Aircraft Pairs 5 NM 10 minutes 2.4.3 Applying Longitudinal Separation on Parallel Tracks not Laterally Separated Where non-intersecting or parallel tracks are not laterally separated, longitudinal separation must be established. Refer to Crossing Tracks Same Direction for required minima. Note: the following diagram illustrates the application of longitudinal minima for ADS-B equipped aircraft. For non-ADS-B equipped aircraft, the minima must be substituted for the correct values. Figure 6 \u2013 Longitudinal Separation on Parallel Tracks 2.4.4 Operations Without A Fixed Speed (OWAFS) All oceanic clearances shall include an assigned Mach number (or airspeed). After oceanic entry, aircraft may be instructed to RESUME NORMAL SPEED on a tactical basis. This allows aircraft to fly a cost index (ECON) speed. ATC must be informed if the speed changes by M0.02 or more from the last assigned Mach number. It is recommended that OWAFS is only applied to aircraft whose planned minimum longitudinal separation from other aircraft is 60NM or greater. Longitudinal separation must be monitored and a fixed Mach number may be re-assigned if necessary.","title":"Separation Standards"},{"location":"controller/sops/general/chap2/#separation-standards","text":"CHAPTER 2","title":"Separation Standards"},{"location":"controller/sops/general/chap2/#21-general","text":"Separation on VATSIM is subject to some simplification.

The optimum routings vary according to departure and destination airfields, enroute weather, winds aloft and aircraft performance. Design To maximise the flow of traffic along the preferred, optimal routings, Shanwick & Gander publish a list of set North Atlantic (NAT) Tracks each day. The process of track design depends upon input from operators, upper wind conditions, limitations of airspace and feasibility for surrounding controlling authorities. This system can accommodate a higher flow of traffic than using \u2018random routings\u2019 for all aircraft. The published tracks are defined by a list of permissible flight levels and series of waypoints, which include an oceanic entry and exit point. These are positioned on the domestic FIR boundaries and are generally named using the standard five-letter convention. Between the entry and exit points, waypoints are defined by Latitude and Longitude (e.g. 57N 040W, also written 5740N or 57/40) and are generally positioned every 10 degrees of longitude. Validity In the real world, the tracks are only valid at certain times of day, with a westbound set published for use for aircraft crossing the 30 degrees west line between 1130 and 1900Z and an eastbound set for aircraft crossing the same line between 0100 and 0800Z. The two sets of tracks are not necessarily laterally separated as they are never valid at the same time. Shanwick OAC (Prestwick) publishes the westbound tracks around 2200z before activation in the morning and Gander OAC publishes the eastbound tracks around 1400z in the afternoon. Naming NATs are named using letters of the alphabet. Westbound tracks are named with the most northerly track designated \u2018Alpha\u2019 and working down the alphabet to the final westbound track. Eastbound tracks are identified with the most southerly track designated \u2018Zulu\u2019 and working up through the alphabet to the final eastbound track. These names are re-used every day when old tracks are removed and new tracks published, though the number of tracks each day may vary. Random Routes The use of the OTS is not mandatory, pilots may file routes that over/under-fly, cross join or leave the system. Any route that does not follow the OTS for the entire track is referred to as a \u201crandom route\u201d. 5.1.2 Track Message Identifier (TMI) The NAT Tracks are published in a single NAT Track Message (NTM) with a Track Message Identification (TMI) number. This is simply the Julian calendar day that the tracks are published. Checking this number confirms that both the pilot and the controller have the latest track information. \u201cTrack Alpha\u201d from one day to another will be a different published route, however \u201cTrack Alpha, TMI 001\u201d will only be repeated once every year (1st January). Occasionally if the NAT message is amended after publication, a letter will be appended to the TMI number (e.g. 001A) and the entire message is re-issued. 5.1.3 NAT Track Message Here is an example of a NAT Track Message (NTM) issued by Gander on 11th March 2021 specifying eastbound tracks valid for the next morning. Only one track is published (Track Z) with only eastbound flight levels specified. The TMI is 071 and further important information is published regarding the provision of ATS below. Figure 7 \u2013 NOTAM Example 5.1.4 Use of OTS on VATSIM On VATSIM, the most recently published tracks can be used at any time and are not limited to the levels published. As such, controllers should be aware that there is the possibility of traffic on eastbound and westbound tracks (where one set is \u2018out of date\u2019) will conflict. If the eastbound and westbound tracks do conflict, coordination must occur between controllers responsible for clearing aircraft in both directions along the OTS. It is advised, in this instance that controllers should clear aircraft on levels that follow the semi-circular rule. 5.2 Tango Routes The Tango routes are a fixed set of routes in the South Eastern of the Shanwick OCA. Clearance delivery must be conducted over HF for northbound aircraft (due to range requirements) but may be conducted on VHF for southbound aircraft. 5.2.1 T9 and T290 T9/T290 are unidirectional routes established just west of the BOTA. They connect the SOTA to the Madrid FIR and are generally used by aircraft from the British Isles to Portugal, the Canaries and Cape Verde Islands. \u25aa T9 - Southbound - LASNO to BEGAS \u25aa T290 - Northbound - ADVAT to GELPO Note: T9/T290 are laterally separated from each other. 5.2.1.1 Transponder Operation on T9/T290 Pilots will reset their assigned SSR code to 2000, 10 minutes after passing LASNO, BEGAS, TAMEL or BERUX. 5.2.2 T213 T213 is a bi directional route established to the West of T290 and connecting the SOTA to the Madrid FIR. \u25aa T213 \u2013 Bi-directional \u2013 TAMEL to BERUX 5.2.3 T13 and T16 T13/T16 are unidirectional routes established just west T213 and cross into Santa Maria Oceanic airspace eventually terminating just North of the Madeira Archipelago. \u25aa T13 - Northbound \u2013 NILAV to OMOKO \u25aa T16 - Southbound - OMOKO to GONAN Note: T13/T16 share a common waypoint (OMOKO) and are therefore not laterally separated. 5.3 North American Routes The North American Routes (NARs) are fixed routes designed for application to aircraft flying oceanic random routes at and above FL290 to transition to domestic airspace. Occasionally the NAT Message will specify NARs which must be used in conjunction with certain tracks. Note: Oceanic controllers do not assign NARs. This section is for information only. Westbound NARs consist of 2 portions; The coastal fix is linked to an inland fix (INF) by what is termed the \u2018common portion\u2019. The \u2018non-common portion\u2019 will then link the inland fix towards the system airports. Where an airport does not have defined non-common portions, pilots should file the full route of the common portion to the inland fix. Eastbound NARs consist of a single portion - the \u2018common portion\u2019 which connect the inland fix to the coastal fix. All NARs are designated by N*, where \u2018N\u2019 is spoken \u201cNorth American Route\u201d and * is the published designator (usually a 1/2-digit number followed by a letter). Most of the routes are divided into two portions: 1. Common Portion - That portion of the route between a specified coastal fix or an oceanic entry/exit point and a specified Inland Navigation Fix (INF). Some routes have a common portion only (N598A-N700A); 2. Non-Common Portion - That portion of the route between a specified INF and a system airport. The routes are within the high-level airspace structure with a transition to/from system airports. The routes are prefixed by the abbreviation \"N\" with the numbering for the common portions orientated geographically from south to north. The ODD numbers have eastbound application while the EVEN numbers apply to westbound. Aircraft can only join the NAR System: \u25aa At the identified coastal fix or oceanic entry/exit point; or \u25aa On departure from one of the identified system airports; or \u25aa At an identified INF. NARs may be assigned by ATC for the tactical management of air traffic in Canadian Domestic airspace.","title":"Route Structures"},{"location":"controller/sops/general/chap5/#route-structures","text":"CHAPTER 5","title":"Route Structures"},{"location":"controller/sops/general/chap5/#51-organised-track-system-ots","text":"","title":"5.1 Organised Track System (OTS)"},{"location":"controller/sops/general/chap5/#511-north-atlantic-nat-tracks","text":"Introduction To minimise flight time and thereby the cost of operating aircraft through oceanic airspace, all operators desire to operate in a relatively small portion of oceanic airspace.

Common Portion - That portion of the route between a specified coastal fix or an oceanic entry/exit point and a specified Inland Navigation Fix (INF).

An Oceanic Clearance is normally issued to an aircraft at least 30 minutes before they enter the Oceanic Control Area. An Oceanic Clearance contains three key elements: Route, usually the NAT / Routing across the North Atlantic Speed, your cruise speed in MACH (not IAS) Level, your cruise altitude as a Flight Level These elements serve to provide the three basic elements of separation: lateral, longitudinal, and vertical as early as possible since the controllers are controlling procedural airspace without any radar coverage. Further Information Oceanic Clearances are required for all flights within the Oceanic Controlled Airspace at or above FL55 (5500 ft). To assist the Oceanic Controllers in planning clearances efficiently and using airspace optimally, pilots requesting an oceanic clearance should notify the clearance controller of their highest possible altitude whenever possible at the oceanic boundary. Considering that the climb to the assigned oceanic flight level must be achieved before entering the oceanic airspace, this should generally be done while the aircraft is within radar controlled airspace such as Shannon or Moncton/Gander. In some airports close to the oceanic boundary such as Gander, Halifax, Moncton, Dublin & Shannon it may be necessary for a pilot to obtain their Oceanic Clearance on the ground. This is usually done to save time so that the pilot can fly straight to the boundary without the need to contact the clearance controller. However, pilots must make sure that they are already at their assigned parameters by the time they reach the oceanic boundary. After pilots obtain and read back their oceanic clearance, pilots should monitor their FIX estimate for oceanic entry. If a change of 3 minutes or more is observed, the pilot must pass the revised estimate to ATC. This is done to recalculate your position in relation to other aircraft so that there is no conflict when entering the oceanic airspace. If a pilot has not received their Oceanic Clearance before entering the Oceanic Airspace, they must contact domestic ATC and request instructions to remain clear of the Oceanic Airspace until they receive their clearance. Aircraft must avoid entering Oceanic Airspace if a controller is online unless they have received their clearance. If in doubt, pilots should ask the Oceanic controller when they can expect their clearance. Each aircraft will be cleared to a specific flight level and Mach number. If a pilot cannot accept a certain level or Mach number they must report it to ATC and provide their available options so that ATC can best accommodate. Workflow from start to finish The following section will explain each element of the clearance exchange. A pilot should call up the Oceanic Controller first to establish initial contact and to make the controller aware that the pilot is looking to request their oceanic clearance.

Let's talk about communication. Most VATSIM pilots are used to the \"Clear, Crisp, Ultra HD\" communication over the Very High Frequency (VHF) radio used in most domestic ATC zones, and is the primary technology used to facilitate Air-Ground-Air (AGA) communication. Whilst the clarity and reliability of VHF transmissions makes them ideal for AGA communication use, the technology's reliance on \u2018line-of-sight\u2019 (just like radar) makes it virtually impossible to communicate with aircraft beyond 250-280 NM. This isn't nearly enough range to cover the entire ocean. Even if it was decided to station remote ships fitted with VHF receivers in the middle of the ocean, the cost and lack of efficiency would grossly outweigh the benefit. For most populated areas around the world, where it is possible to install numerous radio transceivers on land, this limitation is not a factor. However, over the oceans and throughout very remote areas of the world, building a network of VHF transceivers is very difficult, if not impossible. An alternative solution is therefore required. The answer is found through the use of High Frequency (HF) radio. Even with the development of satellite and datalink technology, the reliability of HF means that it remains the predominant method of establishing communication with ATC over remote areas. Audio For VATSIM (AFV) Implementation Whilst most default and add-on aircraft can replicate realistic VHF radio operation, HF, on the other hand, is a bit tricky. It is technically possible to simulate proper HF tuning on VATSIM, however many aircraft simply cannot tune an HF radio. With that being said, a workaround has been devised. Instead of the pilot tuning directly to an HF frequency, the pilot tunes a regular VHF frequency which AFV parses into an HF frequency. How cool is that? Until it is possible to simulate proper HF radio operation, the alias method will be used to enable the HF experience over the network. On VATSIM, there actually isn't much of a difference between VHF and HF (yet! more realistic simulation is planned). The presence of far more static is really the only difference, but it is a key one as it can make communication quite difficult at times. Like VHF, the further away you fly from the receiver location, the less clarity there will be in radio transmissions. Propagation of High-Frequency Radio Waves HF utilises a lower frequency band (3 MHz to 30 MHz) than VHF. Frequencies in this band have longer wavelengths than those in the VHF band. As a result, instead of continuing in a straight line, through the atmosphere and into space, the waves can be reflected by the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, allowing for \u2018over the horizon\u2019 communication. This allows communication via HF to be effective over extremely long ranges, as far as 8,000 NM or even further under ideal conditions. Transmissions over HF are able to \u2018skip\u2019 across the ionosphere, enabling \u2018over the horizon\u2019 communication. HF radio waves can propagate as 'ground waves' or \u2018sky waves\u2019. Ground waves are received over shorter distances closer to the transmitter. Sky waves, on the other hand, can travel far greater distances. At the longer wavelengths used in HF communication, the waves can interact with the ionosphere, an electrically-charged layer of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The waves bounce directly off the ionosphere and back towards the ground. The signal is often reflected multiple times, \u2018skipping\u2019 between the surface of the Earth and the ionosphere, and as a result, the waves can propagate many thousands of miles. An analogy to understand this is the idea of skipping a stone across water, at the right angle, the stone bounces off the surface of the water and back into the air, often several times. The maximum range for HF radio waves is heavily dependent upon atmospheric conditions, the angle at which the signal meets the ionosphere and the frequency of the radio wave. For example, at night, the ionosphere is generally lower than during the day. This means that the angle at which the radio waves make contact with it is shallower and therefore they can skip further. Sky waves can skip several times to cover extremely large distances. The frequency of the radio wave also plays an important role. As a general rule of thumb, higher frequencies (10-30 MHz) work better during the day, and lower frequencies (2-10 MHz) work better at night. The Incessant Static Naturally with the nature of HF radio propagation, there is a propensity to pick up a level of atmospheric interference. The more bounces the wave performs, the more interference that can occur. This is why HF can be very noisy. The Future of Oceanic Communication In recent years, HF has been put under the spotlight. Whilst HF is very reliable, it is noisy, as mentioned, and alternatives to the technology have been explored. One of these solutions has been CPDLC (Controller-Pilot Data Link Communication). Using CPDLC, a pilot can compose text messages and communicate with the controller without using the radio. CPDLC has become a very viable solution in many areas of the world as an alternative to voice communication in non-urgent situations. ADS-B/ADS-C is another solution that has largely superseded the need for voice position reporting. Currently, a combination of ADS-C and Space-Based ADS-B is used to provide regular, real-time aircraft position updates as well as event-based updates (e.g. aircraft is climbing; aircraft is leaving designated route), as fast as every seven seconds. Because of this, on the VATSIM network, aircraft that do have an ADS-B or ADS-C equipment are not required to provide position reports, however, they are more than welcome to do so if the controller workload permits them to do so! Tips for using High-Frequency Radio Most of the time, you will be communicating with the controllers via the radio, but as mentioned, communicating with the controllers can be a bit tricky. Here are some tips to help you out. Speak slowly on the frequency - both the controller and yourself hear the same transmission quality and speaking at a lower rate ensures that the controller has the best chance of understanding you. Sometimes the controller will need to write down elements of your transmission and a slower transmission assists them greatly Depress your Push-To-Talk (PTT) button fully before speaking, however, do not depress your PTT until you are ready to speak Avoid turning your head away from the microphone, and aim to keep the distance between your mouth and the microphone the same whilst speaking Use a normal conversation volume; there is no need to speak any louder Speak clearly and evenly A slight pause before and after any numbers will make them easier to understand Avoid including unnecessary words or phrases in your message (as well as hesitations such as \u201cerr\u201d, \u201cuhh\u201d, etc.); the more concise the transmission, the better. A good rule of thumb is: if the transmission still conveys your message after you leave a particular word out, then the word should not be in the transmission Avoid excessive use of courtesies, and avoid entering into non-operational conversations over the radio Keep in mind that the controller's native language may not be English \u2013 speak clearly and use standard radiotelephony (RTF) words and phrases wherever possible Messages should not contain more than three specific phrases, comprising a clearance, instruction, and any pertinent information. In many cases, the controller may pass each phrase separately to reduce the possibility of a misunderstanding Do not release the PTT button until after you have completely finished speaking to avoid \u2018clipping\u2019 the end of your transmission When transmitting a message, it is a good idea to say your callsign twice and wait for the controller to respond before passing your full request. This ensures the controller is ready to receive your transmission and knows exactly where it is coming from Most importantly of them all! Wait for the frequency to fall silent before transmitting otherwise you may block someone else's important transmission Sources Audio for VATSIM Documentation https://www.skybrary.aero/index.php/Automatic_Dependent_Surveillance_(ADS) NAT Document 007","title":"Using HF Radio"},{"location":"pilots/atc/hf-radio/#communication-over-high-frequency","text":"","title":"Communication over High Frequency"},{"location":"pilots/atc/hf-radio/#what-is-high-frequency-radio","text":"Let's talk about communication.

This allows communication via HF to be effective over extremely long ranges, as far as 8,000 NM or even further under ideal conditions. Transmissions over HF are able to \u2018skip\u2019 across the ionosphere, enabling \u2018over the horizon\u2019 communication. HF radio waves can propagate as 'ground waves' or \u2018sky waves\u2019. Ground waves are received over shorter distances closer to the transmitter. Sky waves, on the other hand, can travel far greater distances. At the longer wavelengths used in HF communication, the waves can interact with the ionosphere, an electrically-charged layer of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. The waves bounce directly off the ionosphere and back towards the ground. The signal is often reflected multiple times, \u2018skipping\u2019 between the surface of the Earth and the ionosphere, and as a result, the waves can propagate many thousands of miles. An analogy to understand this is the idea of skipping a stone across water, at the right angle, the stone bounces off the surface of the water and back into the air, often several times. The maximum range for HF radio waves is heavily dependent upon atmospheric conditions, the angle at which the signal meets the ionosphere and the frequency of the radio wave. For example, at night, the ionosphere is generally lower than during the day. This means that the angle at which the radio waves make contact with it is shallower and therefore they can skip further. Sky waves can skip several times to cover extremely large distances. The frequency of the radio wave also plays an important role. As a general rule of thumb, higher frequencies (10-30 MHz) work better during the day, and lower frequencies (2-10 MHz) work better at night.","title":"Propagation of High-Frequency Radio Waves"},{"location":"pilots/atc/hf-radio/#the-incessant-static","text":"Naturally with the nature of HF radio propagation, there is a propensity to pick up a level of atmospheric interference.

Whilst HF is very reliable, it is noisy, as mentioned, and alternatives to the technology have been explored. One of these solutions has been CPDLC (Controller-Pilot Data Link Communication). Using CPDLC, a pilot can compose text messages and communicate with the controller without using the radio. CPDLC has become a very viable solution in many areas of the world as an alternative to voice communication in non-urgent situations. ADS-B/ADS-C is another solution that has largely superseded the need for voice position reporting. Currently, a combination of ADS-C and Space-Based ADS-B is used to provide regular, real-time aircraft position updates as well as event-based updates (e.g. aircraft is climbing; aircraft is leaving designated route), as fast as every seven seconds. Because of this, on the VATSIM network, aircraft that do have an ADS-B or ADS-C equipment are not required to provide position reports, however, they are more than welcome to do so if the controller workload permits them to do so!","title":"The Future of Oceanic Communication"},{"location":"pilots/atc/hf-radio/#tips-for-using-high-frequency-radio","text":"Most of the time, you will be communicating with the controllers via the radio, but as mentioned, communicating with the controllers can be a bit tricky. Here are some tips to help you out. Speak slowly on the frequency - both the controller and yourself hear the same transmission quality and speaking at a lower rate ensures that the controller has the best chance of understanding you. Sometimes the controller will need to write down elements of your transmission and a slower transmission assists them greatly Depress your Push-To-Talk (PTT) button fully before speaking, however, do not depress your PTT until you are ready to speak Avoid turning your head away from the microphone, and aim to keep the distance between your mouth and the microphone the same whilst speaking Use a normal conversation volume; there is no need to speak any louder Speak clearly and evenly A slight pause before and after any numbers will make them easier to understand Avoid including unnecessary words or phrases in your message (as well as hesitations such as \u201cerr\u201d, \u201cuhh\u201d, etc.); the more concise the transmission, the better. A good rule of thumb is: if the transmission still conveys your message after you leave a particular word out, then the word should not be in the transmission Avoid excessive use of courtesies, and avoid entering into non-operational conversations over the radio Keep in mind that the controller's native language may not be English \u2013 speak clearly and use standard radiotelephony (RTF) words and phrases wherever possible Messages should not contain more than three specific phrases, comprising a clearance, instruction, and any pertinent information. In many cases, the controller may pass each phrase separately to reduce the possibility of a misunderstanding Do not release the PTT button until after you have completely finished speaking to avoid \u2018clipping\u2019 the end of your transmission When transmitting a message, it is a good idea to say your callsign twice and wait for the controller to respond before passing your full request. This ensures the controller is ready to receive your transmission and knows exactly where it is coming from Most importantly of them all!

However, there are still many aircraft - especially on VATSIM that are not equipped with ADS-B or ADS-C equipment. This is where position reports come in. Many routes over the North Atlantic define designated \u2018reporting points\u2019; points at which a pilot must report their position.

Pilots must always report to ATC when reaching new flight levels, and optionally when leaving the old flight level.

Listening to this background static for a whole six-hour flight would be distracting and difficult, so Selective Calling (or SELCAL) was devised so that pilots can turn down their noisy radios. How does it work? Many aircraft are assigned a four-letter \u2018SELCAL code\u2019 enabling them to make use of the system. When a ground operator wishes to communicate with an aircraft, they enter the aircraft's SELCAL code into an encoder which converts each letter into a designated audio tone. The converted tones are broadcast over the radio frequency and are received and interpreted by a decoder on the aircraft's radio receiver, and if the tones match the aircraft's assigned code, then the crew is alerted by a chime, a light, or both. This gives the crew enough time to turn up their radios and receive the transmission from the operator. Image source: VATSIM New Zealand Can I choose any code Not quite. The SELCAL system supports sixteen characters from the Latin alphabet (letters A through S , excluding I , N and O ) and the characters are written/transmitted in alphabetical order as two ordered pairs of characters. For example, the code AB-CD is valid, as well as CD-AB , however, BA-CD and DC-BA are not. Each letter in any given code must be unique, so both AA-BC and AC-CD are invalid. Can I use SELCAL on VATSIM? SELCAL is simulated on VATSIM by all major pilot clients. Simply enter your SELCAL code and connect!

It might seem daunting at first, but this vast stretch of ocean isn't all that hard to master, and we're glad that you're interested in the world of oceanic flight! \"But surely oceanic can't be that different to domestic?\" Well, yes and no. In many areas, there are similarities, though the nature of the airspace makes it hard to conduct domestic-like operations. Let's dive into some of the key differences. No Primary or Secondary Radar?! Nope! Controllers cannot use radar to work out where you are. There is simply nowhere to place a radar antenna in the vastness of the North Atlantic. Instead, in this \u2018procedural airspace\u2019, the oceanic controllers rely on reports from you, the pilot. Nowadays, these reports are often automatically generated using a combination of ADS-C and Space-Based ADS-B equipment on the aircraft which automatically send updated position reports to oceanic controllers which allows controllers to use reduced separation minima across the ocean. However, we still rely on position reports for aircraft that lack ADS-B and ADS-C equipment (see Position Reporting ). No such luxury! Why is it so hard to understand what the oceanic controller is saying? On top of the lack of radar, there is the problem of long-range communication. As with radar, VHF (Very High-Frequency) radio is line-of-sight, which becomes an issue after an aircraft disappears over the horizon into the vastness of the North Atlantic skies. Therefore, a radio technology is needed that does not rely on line-of-sight and the solution to this is HF (High Frequency) radio. By its nature, HF radio is very noisy and does not have the same clarity as VHF radio, and thus it can sometimes be difficult to understand the oceanic controller. Quick tips: If you didn't understand what the controller said, ask them to repeat it or explain it differently. Asking the controller to clarify what they meant is a lot easier than trying to wrap your head around a transmission that you didn't understand. Speak slowly and clearly! Oceanic controllers use the same noisy frequency, and they need you to make it easy for them to understand your transmissions too. Speak your callsign twice, sometimes the controller may miss it the first time due to the static and it can be handy to reduce the overall amount of time on the radio. For more detailed information, visit our page dedicated to the idiosyncrasies of High-Frequency radio. High-Frequency Radio Tower I need two clearances? It sounds a bit silly to receive another clearance, but in fact, this \u2018Oceanic Clearance\u2019 (see Getting Your Clearance ) is the most important element of your flight. We discussed the nature of \u2018procedural airspace\u2019 earlier on, and another consequence of this particular oceanic quirk is the increased requirement of separation. Oceanic controllers can't employ the same minima as they would in a domestic environment, and by the time they detect a conflict between two aircraft, it may be too late. To minimise the risk of any conflict during an aircraft's crossing, the Oceanic Clearance is used to separate aircraft from the very point they enter the airspace. Ideally, with the right clearance, there should be no need for a controller to make an emergency correction whilst the aircraft is inside the airspace. Of course, in reality, this is sometimes necessary, no pilot or controller is perfect, however with the help of technology controllers can minimise and detect risks more efficiently than ever before. The aim is to avoid close calls like this!","title":"First prinicples"},{"location":"pilots/basics/first-principles/#first-prinicples","text":"","title":"First prinicples"},{"location":"pilots/basics/first-principles/#flying-over-the-north-atlantic","text":"Welcome to the North Atlantic!

No such luxury!","title":"No Primary or Secondary Radar?!"},{"location":"pilots/basics/first-principles/#why-is-it-so-hard-to-understand-what-the-oceanic-controller-is-saying","text":"On top of the lack of radar, there is the problem of long-range communication. As with radar, VHF (Very High-Frequency) radio is line-of-sight, which becomes an issue after an aircraft disappears over the horizon into the vastness of the North Atlantic skies. Therefore, a radio technology is needed that does not rely on line-of-sight and the solution to this is HF (High Frequency) radio. By its nature, HF radio is very noisy and does not have the same clarity as VHF radio, and thus it can sometimes be difficult to understand the oceanic controller. Quick tips: If you didn't understand what the controller said, ask them to repeat it or explain it differently. Asking the controller to clarify what they meant is a lot easier than trying to wrap your head around a transmission that you didn't understand. Speak slowly and clearly! Oceanic controllers use the same noisy frequency, and they need you to make it easy for them to understand your transmissions too. Speak your callsign twice, sometimes the controller may miss it the first time due to the static and it can be handy to reduce the overall amount of time on the radio.

We discussed the nature of \u2018procedural airspace\u2019 earlier on, and another consequence of this particular oceanic quirk is the increased requirement of separation. Oceanic controllers can't employ the same minima as they would in a domestic environment, and by the time they detect a conflict between two aircraft, it may be too late. To minimise the risk of any conflict during an aircraft's crossing, the Oceanic Clearance is used to separate aircraft from the very point they enter the airspace. Ideally, with the right clearance, there should be no need for a controller to make an emergency correction whilst the aircraft is inside the airspace. Of course, in reality, this is sometimes necessary, no pilot or controller is perfect, however with the help of technology controllers can minimise and detect risks more efficiently than ever before. The aim is to avoid close calls like this!","title":"I need two clearances?"},{"location":"pilots/basics/flight-plan/","text":"Planning your Flight Oceanic flight planning can be a handful. With so many nuances and procedures that are different from domestic flight, it is easy to feel overwhelmed. However, with enough practice, it is an immensely gratifying skill and a tool that you can add to your VATSIM arsenal. In this article, we will outline the basics of oceanic flight planning and some tips and tricks you can take advantage of to perform a successful oceanic flight. Routes In the previous article (see NAT Tracks ) we discussed the two main types of oceanic routing, NAT Track and Random Routing. However, which one do you choose? As discussed, eastbound and westbound flight on the OTS are only available at certain times of the day. Much of the time, it will be possible to utilise a NAT track, and if this is the case, then it should be the preferred option, however, there are many situations where a published track is simply not available for a pilot's direction of flight and/or requirements. Therefore, a Random Routing is required. Many flight planning tools such as SimBrief generate a suitable Random Routing, however, at times, it may be necessary to make one up. In that case, observe the high-level weather forecast and plot a logical route, for example, select a waypoint every 10 degrees of longitude. Flight Levels Each of the NAT tracks has a published set of specific flight levels allocated between the FL310 and FL400 band. This makes altitude choice relatively easy for a designated track. Random Routings, however, have their own set of flight levels depending on direction of flight. These are summarised in the below table: Level Time Direction FL430 All Westbound FL410 All Eastbound FL400 All Westbound FL390 All Eastbound FL380 0801z-2229z 2230z-0800z Westbound Eastbound FL370 All Eastbound FL360 All Westbound FL350 All Eastbound FL340 0801z-2229z 2230z-0800z Westbound Eastbound FL330 1901z-0959z 1000z-1900z Eastbound Westbound FL320 All Westbound FL310 All Westbound FL300 All Westbound FL290 All Eastbound Mach Number Instead of Indicated Airspeed (IAS), Mach is used in oceanic airspace. Mach is very important for aircraft operating at high levels at high speed, as it is a better representation of the aircraft's actual speed through the air than ground speed or IAS at cruising levels. Pilots may file their preferred Mach number and in most cases will receive a clearance with that Mach number. It is rare for a controller to assign anything more than .02 Mach below or .01 Mach above the requested speed. Speed in oceanic airspace is measured in \u201cMach\u201d, which ratio between the aircraft's true airspeed (TAS) and the speed of sound. Other General Tips If you don't understand what the controller said, say so! They will explain it to you in a different way. Likewise, if you cannot do something, tell them that you are \u2018unable\u2019 and they can find an alternative. If you are not sure about any aspect of your oceanic flight, don't be afraid to private message the oceanic controller. More often than not, they will be more than happy to help you out. If you need something from the controller, for example, a change of flight level or a change of speed, just ask! In many cases, the controller can accommodate the request.

As a result of these flows, most traffic is concentrated uni-directionally depending on the time of day. Peak westbound traffic crosses 30W between 1130z and 1900z, whilst peak eastbound traffic crosses 30W between 0100z and 0800z. On top of these operational characteristics, wind, airline requests and controller separation requirements play essential roles. Aircraft typically need to fly between a narrow level band (between FL310 and FL400) and will attempt to fly with the strongest tailwind (eastbound crossing) or will try to avoid the headwind (westbound crossing). All of these considerations prompt the need for a system of dynamic routes across the North Atlantic. This system is known as the Organised Track System, or OTS for short. Each day, the OTS is constructed with the cooperation of all relevant OACCs (Oceanic Area Control Centres) to ensure that the best possible routes are chosen for the conditions. The agreed OTS for the day is then forwarded through the \u2018NAT track message\u2019. The NAT track message details all of the agreed-upon North Atlantic routings for the flow and messages are typically published twice a day, at 2200z and 1400z.

Each message is issued a TMI (Track Message Identifier), which is simply the current Julian calendar day (up to 365, assuming non-leap year). In situations where an amendment needs to be made, a letter is appended to the end of the TMI (e.g. 123A), and the message is re-issued. It is important to clarify the TMI in all clearance readbacks, as it is possible to have received an outdated NAT message by mistake. It Takes Five to Tango Five routes exist in the far south-east corner of Shanwick's airspace to connect routes between Shannon's SOTA area and Spain, the Canaries and the Lisbon FIR. These routes do not change daily and are known as the \u2018Tango Routes\u2019 or \u2018T Routes\u2019 for short. T9: provides a north/south route connecting airways routing between the west of the Portuguese Coast to eastbound routings across the north of Spain. T9 connects SOTA to the Madrid FIR between LASNO and BEGAS. This Tango Route is uni-directional and can only be received by southbound flight. T213 : also connects SOTA to the Madrid FIR routing TAMEL and BERUX, forming more limited connections to the western edge of the Lisboa FIR and several southbound routes through Spain towards Tunisia. This Tango Route is bi-directional. T16: connects SOTA to the Canaries, routing OMOKO and GONAN. This Tango Route is uni-directional, and can only be received by southbound flight T13: sister to T16, routing OMOKO and NILAV. This Tango Route is uni-directional, and can only be received by northbound flight T290: new as of 30th Jan 2020, connecting SOTA to the Madrid FIR, routing GELPO and ADVAT. This Tango Route is uni-directional and can only be received by southbound flight. Note: Expect to hear the waypoints for these routes individually read out in the clearance to reduce the chance of a misunderstanding. The Tango (T) Routes What about Concorde? Even though the Concorde hasn't been seen in the real-world skies since 2003, pilots looking for a nostalgia kick might want to dust off their Concorde on the network. Therefore, the three legacy Concorde tracks remain available for use today on the network. Unlike regular NAT tracks, these tracks are static and did not change daily because the Concorde's high cruising altitude (between FL550 and FL600) meant that the aircraft flew above most weather systems that impact normal NAT track selection. Let's have a look at these routes.

Acknowleding your clearance and reverting to voice There is no requirement to acknowledge oceanic clearances on natTrak, unlike on voice. If needed, ATC may reject your oceanic clearance request via natTrak and contact you asking to request via voice. Some controllers will utilise the 'revert to voice' feature on natTrak, which sends a message to you on natTrak. Others will send a message via your pilot client. Need more help?

As with all oceanic clearances , be sure to submit your request at least 30 minutes prior to entry. If you submit it via natTrak less than 15 minutes prior to entry , it will not be possible to request clearance via the website and you will need to do so via voice. Notes Flying Oceanic There are a few different things to take into account when flying Oceanic airspace: Oceanic Controllers have ADS-B (Satalite Radar) capabilities, but they can not vector you. So you need to fly your route as cleared. Your Simulator Time must be set to the correct time. You need this in order to correctly provide your entry time into the OCA. Accessing the oceanic clearance request page Log onto the natTrak Website with your VATSIM Account. When logged on as a pilot on VATSIM, you will see a Navigation Bar with options to Request Clearance, as well as viewing a history of clearance message. Filling out the form You should see a form asking for your flight details. Section 1 - Callsign, destination, level, speed The first section of the form asks for your callsign, destination, requested flight level, maximum flight level, and requested mach speed. Callsign: Your callsign as per your VATSIM connection. natTrak will attempt to detect this for you. Destination ICAO: The ICAO code of your final destination airport, EGLL for example. natTrak will attempt to detect this for you. Requested flight level: The flight level you wish to fly during your crossing. For Cross the Pond, this must be the flight level that was allocated to you in your booking details. Type this as three digits, for example FL420 will be 420. Maximum flight level: The highest possible flight level you can fly at the beginning of your oceanic crossing. This is generally given to you in your aircraft's VNAV FMC page. Requested mach number: The mach number you are requesting to fly during your crossing. Type this as three digits beginning with 0. For example, mach .81 will be 081. LNAV Page in PMDG 777 Section 2 - Routeing Here you can specify whether you are requesting a NAT Track, or a random routeing. The tracks dropdown will display the current active NAT tracks available. Select the one you are requesting. Leave the random routeing box blank. If you are flying a random routeing, paste it into the second box. Select None on the tracks dropdown. Section 3 - Oceanic entry Here you enter the oceanic entry point (typically the first waypoint on your track/random routeing) and your calculated estimate of arriving at that waypoint. It is critical that you use real world time for the estimate. For example, if you are flying track A routeing by `NEBIN 54/20 55/30 55/40 53/50 PELTU`, your entry fix will be `NEBIN`. Your estimate for arriving at `NEBIN` can be found in your FMS. RTE Page in PMDG 777 Section 4 - TMI, free text Enter the current TMI (see NAT Tracks for details). For Cross the Pond this may be different from the current real world one - check the menu bar on the top of the page for the current one. You can also enter free text if you wish. Use this for extra details or the like. You can now submit the form using the blue button. If there are errors in your input, you will be redirected back to the form and shown what to fix. What now? You should be presented with your message history page with your request details. Continue reading on this page for more details! Need more help?
