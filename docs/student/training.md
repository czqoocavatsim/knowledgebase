Welcome to the Gander Oceanic Student SOPs. This is our guide for aspiring C1 controllers to view the process which Gander Oceanic conducts training, as well as have a one stop shop for all materials which you need to review before beginning training.

## Training Process
Our process is quite simple for an Endorsement, as you have already attained the requirements of a C1 rating, our job is only to teach you the process of controlling Oceanic.

1. Application for Endorsement

The first step in your training is to apply to gain the endorsement. A response can take up to three days, so we recommend you take this time to prepare for the Exam which you will need to do, by reviewing all of our ATC.
