## Selecting a profile
If it is your first time using VATSYS it should open a page looking like this 

<figure markdown>
![Profile Selction](/controller/img/vatsysprofileselect.png){ width="250" }
  <figcaption>Profile selection window</figcaption>
</figure>
Simply double click on the NAT profile 

If a profile (eg Australia) has loaded up, to change profile, simply click `Settings > Change profile.  to bring up profile selection menu above
Selecting your Position
	Your position selection sets your sectors and vis points for you ready to connect. To select a profile simply click, Settings > Position > Position you wish to control. You’re welcome to change this, just note that your sectors, vis points and callsign will not change automatically.

## Connection Window



Callsign will auto-fill, based on your select position, however a drop down of callsigns will appear. Note, not all callsigns that may appear here are allowed to be controlled by CZQO rated controllers.


Range is set automatically and is strongly encouraged you do not change. This as well is based on the position you chose.


Controller info is set as you’re expected to control with. You’re more than welcome to add to it, however avoid removing critical info. NOTE: At time of writing CPDLC is not available on VATSYS and is therefore N/A. If you decide to use an external CPDLC client you’re welcome to add the correct CPDLC loggon code into your controller info.

VSCS Window
	Who on earth wants to have to open an extra client just for audio??
	
	The VSCS window covers all your audio, coordination, and frequency needs.
Setup Tab

	This is where you can add freqs (note your freq becomes “primed” when you receive on it), mute your co-ord (mute input) send audio to speakers (if you have them setup and need to dash away for any reason) and open your audio settings. NOTE: push to talk by default is left shift and can be adjusted in settings>keyboard.
Coord Tab

	Where voice communication can occur. Red Boxes are hotlines, and Blue boxes are cold lines. If the text is black, the station is NOT using VATSYS/mumble services. If the text is white, they ARE and can be coordinated. Hotlines open an active voice line to the station without needing them to accept. Coldlines require the receiving controller to accept the call.
Text Tab

The location for your Frequency Text chat, this is where you can see the full history and send messages to your frequencies text channel. Note: when you receive a message a window will appear, if words like Request, are used, you can reply by clicking on the green background text. Any messages sent in the Text Tab are undirected messages and will appear as a general broadcast message. If you wish to send a direct message on freq, use the FREETEXT function on the CPDLC panel (not ACARS)
Camera Controls
 	All keybinds are rebindable  Settings > Keyboard
	Arrow Keys control your position, Middle mouse drag can be used to “peak”.
	Zoom is page up and down
	Insert can be used to save a camera position, Delete to return to it.
	Home returns you to default camera position
Messages
	
	To open a direct message, go up to Messages > Send > (and either select a callsign (observers and controllers) or type in a callsign. All previous messages will appear under send, you can middle mouse click them to hide them and remove the local history of them.
Tags/Labels
What is that beeping noise?
		There are a few noises as warnings on tags. All of them are mutable through middle clicking the text of the warning on the tag. Locate the tag with Yellow text on the top right corner stating either CLAM, RAM, SAR, STCA. Middle Mouse click on the text to mute. 
Please contact me on…
	To send a contact me one must first have the aircraft selected, denoted by the strip being highlighted and/or the radar return encircled in the selection octagon
Then simply press the F6 key on your keyboard (changeable in keyboard settings) and select the correct freq (usually only one available unless coupling multiple)
Handoff tags
	There are multiple ways to hand off, the quickest would be to select the aircraft (as mentioned above) then press the numpad plus key to open the hand-off window. 

	Alternate methods to bring this window up include clicking the controlling sector on the strip. Or opening the control menu by clicking on the destination (on the strip) or callsign (on the tag) then clicking handoff.

	Once on the handoff menu, the suggested sector will be highlighted and once you’ve confirmed that is the correct sector you can either click it or press enter on the keyboard.
