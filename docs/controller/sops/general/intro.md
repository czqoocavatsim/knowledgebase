The North Atlantic region consists of the Nuuk, Reykjavík, Bodø Oceanic, Shanwick Oceanic, Gander Oceanic,
New York Oceanic and Santa Maria Oceanic FIRs. This document defines procedures for the Shanwick and
Gander Oceanic Control Areas (OCAs).

Shanwick and Gander use a mix of space-based surveillance systems, satellite communication, and HF and VHF
radios to manage aircraft within their respective OCAs. HF stations are staffed by Radio Operators at Gander
(“Gander Radio”) in Canada and Ballygirreen (“Shanwick Radio”) in the Republic of Ireland. The Oceanic Area
Control Centres are located respectively in Gander and Prestwick (Scotland), which act as the controlling
authorities for their respective OCAs. On VATSIM, the distinction between Radio Operator and Controller is not
made, with the Oceanic Controller responsible for the airspace and in contact with pilots.

Previously, ATS within the NAT Region was provided procedurally using position reports. Shanwick and Gander
can now utilise space-based surveillance systems such as Automatic Dependent Surveillance (ADS).
Communication can be over voice or via Controller-Pilot Datalink Communication (CPDLC) where aircraft
equipment allows.
