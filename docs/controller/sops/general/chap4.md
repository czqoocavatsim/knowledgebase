#  General Coordination Regulation
CHAPTER 4

Any traffic that is not deemed coordinated under the terms of this chapter shall be individually
coordinated.

## 4.1 Deemed Coordination of Traffic Between Shanwick and Gander
Aircraft transferred between Shanwick and Gander shall be deemed coordinated provided:<br>
▪ the aircraft is operating in compliance with their current oceanic clearance;<br>
▪ if operating on a NAT Track, is at a level specified in the NTM for the direction of flight;<br>
▪ the RFL has not been changed level within 15 minutes of the common sector boundary;<br>
▪ no objection has been raised by the receiving controller.<br>

## 4.2 Deemed Coordination of En-Route Traffic Entering the OCA
Aircraft in receipt of an oceanic clearance shall be deemed coordinated provided that:<br>
▪ the aircraft is at the level specified in the oceanic clearance;<br>
▪ the aircraft will cross the oceanic entry point within 3 minutes of the most recently
received time estimate or according to a time restriction specified in the oceanic clearance
and;<br>
▪ no objection has been raised by the receiving controller.

## 4.3 Deemed Coordination of En-Route Traffic Leaving the OCA
Cruising traffic which has reached the RFL indicated on the flight plan is deemed to have been
coordinated provided that:<br>
▪ the RFL has not been changed within 5 minutes of the oceanic exit point and;<br>
▪ there is no known conflict and separation is maintained against OCA traffic;<br>
▪ no objection has been raised by the receiving controller.

## 4.4 Transfer of Control and Communication
Transfer of control and communications is at the receiving sector boundary except:<br>
▪ For aircraft entering the Shannon (EISN) FIR (or NOTA/SOTA) from Shanwick between
SUNOT and BEDRA (inclusive):<br>
o Transfer of Control – sector boundary<br>
o Transfer of Communications – 1 degree prior to sector boundary<br>

### 4.4.1 Transfer of Tags
On VATSIM, two distinct methods are used for the transfer of tags. The Gander and Shanwick OCAs
border regions that use different methods.

### 4.4.1.1 Silent Method (Oceanic and Europe)
The silent transfer method shall be employed between:<br>
▪ All oceanic sectors and;<br>
▪ Shanwick OAC and all adjacent domestic sectors.

Under the silent transfer method, controllers shall transfer communications together with the
transfer of the aircraft’s tag. Receiving controllers shall only ‘accept’ the transfer of an aircraft tag
from the transferring controller when the aircraft has ‘checked in’ on the receiving controller’s
frequency.

### 4.4.1.2 Confirmed Method (Americas)
The other transfer method shall be employed between:<br>
▪ Gander OAC and all adjacent domestic sectors.
Under the confirmed method, the transferring controller shall initiate transfer of the aircraft’s tag
and wait until the receiving controller has ‘accepted’ the tag before transferring communications.

## 4.5 Coordination of Direct Routings
Direct routings that cross sector boundaries must be coordinated. This coordination may be
completed electronically via the COPX function of EuroScope.

Controllers should be aware that accepted coordination of a direct routing only appears in the
datablock for the coordinating and receiving controller. It is therefore advisable for the current
controller to re-enter/re-type any direct into the datablock after it has been agreed via
electronic coordination.
