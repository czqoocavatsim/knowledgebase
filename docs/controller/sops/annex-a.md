# Annex A | HF Phraseology

The following guidance is provided to highlight differences between domestic and oceanic phraseology. It is intended to complement phraseology examples in the North Atlantic Operations and Airspace Manual (NAT Doc 007).

## 1.1 General

| Component                | Standard Radiotelephony                                                                 |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Airports & ICAO Codes    | Individual phonetic letters, e.g. TBPB – “tango bravo papa bravo” or unique airport name, e.g. EGAA - “Belfast Aldergrove” |
| Mach Number              | “Mach decimal eight-five”                                                               |
| Times/Numbers            | Individual numbers, e.g. 1330 - “one three three zero”                                  |
| NAT Track                | Phonetic letters e.g. Track A – “track alpha”                                           |
| Latitudes                | 2 individual digits e.g. 51N – “five one north”                                         |
| Longitudes               | 2 or 3 individual digits e.g. 030W – “(zero) three zero west”                           |

## 1.2 Oceanic Clearance

### General Notes

- If the NAT Track is the same one specified in the flight plan, it is not required to be stated in the request. If it is not, pilots will add the phrase “now requesting track __”.
- Pilots may optionally add the phrase “second choice track __”.
- Maximum flight level may be the same as the requested level.
- If the clearance is not as requested, the pilot must be informed using the phrase “oceanic clearance with a _____ change”. Refer to Changes to Requested Clearance.
- Whilst providing an oceanic clearance, aircraft are often still in domestic airspace where the oceanic controller is not the controlling authority.
- The callsign “Shanwick (or Gander) Oceanic” is included in the clearance to indicate the clearance came from the controlling authority.
- Controllers should not provide the TMI in the clearance but should ensure the pilot provides it in the readback. TMI is not required from aircraft on a random routing.
- Concorde phraseology is different.

## 1.3 Initial Check-in with Oceanic Controller

### 1.3.1 ADS-B Equipped Aircraft

#### General Notes

- When requesting a SELCAL check, pilots are not required to state the SELCAL code.
- Frequencies for the next sector may be provided on first contact, although the risk of the pilot incorrectly changing frequency immediately must be considered. If required, this can be delayed to a separate transmission closer to the next sector boundary.
- The phrase “monitor this frequency” can be used to highlight the requirement to maintain a listening watch on the current frequency prior to contacting the next sector.
- Aircraft that are not ADS-B equipped will check in with a position report and request for SELCAL check. After the last position report in the current sector is received, contact details for the next sector shall be provided.

| Speaker          | Message                                                                                       |

### 1.3.2 Non-ADS-B Equipped Aircraft (Position Reports)

#### General Notes

- Aircraft that are not ADS-B equipped will check in with a position report and request for SELCAL check, followed by position reports passing each waypoint.
- After the last position report in the current sector is received, contact details for the next sector shall be provided.
- Pilots are not required to include their current/cleared Mach number in a position report, unless a speed change (via an amended clearance) has occurred since the previous position report.

## 1.4 Revisions/Amendments

### General Notes

- Instructions to report leaving or report reaching are optional and should be appended to the climb instruction if required.
- Amended clearances may include a geographic or time restriction whereby the instruction may only be commenced after a certain point/time or alternatively must be complied with prior to a certain point/time.
- The same format is used for speed/route changes, with the phraseology “Amended speed/route clearance…”
