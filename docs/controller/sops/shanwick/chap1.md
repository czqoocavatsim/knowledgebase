## 1.2 Shanwick Delivery Positions
Shanwick Delivery provides oceanic clearance delivery for aircraft initially entering oceanic airspace in the Shanwick OCA.

| Designator  | Relief      | Coordination Name    | VHF Frequency|
| :---------- | :---------- | :------------------------ | :------ |
| EGGX_DEL    | EGGX__ DEL  | Shanwick Delivery         | 127.650 |
| EGGX_A_ DEL | EGGX_1_ DEL | Shanwick Delivery Alpha   | 127.900 |
| EGGX_B_ DEL | EGGX_2_ DEL | Shanwick Delivery Bravo   | 123.950 |
| EGGX_C_ DEL | EGGX_3_ DEL | Shanwick Delivery Charlie | 124.175 |
| EGGX_D_ DEL | EGGX_4_ DEL | Shanwick Delivery Delta   | 126.375 |
| EGGX_F_ DEL | EGGX_5_ DEL | Shanwick Delivery Foxtrot | 128.375 |

## 1.3 Radiotelephony Callsigns
On VATSIM, the following callsigns may be used:<br>
▪ HF Frequencies (may utilise VHF alias on VATSIM): "Shanwick Radio".<br>
▪ VHF Frequencies for clearance delivery: “Shanwick Oceanic” or "Shanwick Radio".

NAT Bandbox shall use the appropriate callsign for Shanwick or Gander, depending on the position
of the aircraft.

## 1.4 Splitting Procedures
EGGX_CTR must be staffed before any other Shanwick position can be manned.

Due to the variable nature of the NAT routings, division of responsibility between controllers is not
published. Splits which divide the OCAs north/south should be agreed between the relevant
controllers and coordinated with adjacent sectors. It is also not uncommon for controllers to
implement another split (e.g. Clearance, Track Controller).
## 1.5 Extended Coverage
NAT_FSS covers the Shanwick and Gander OCAs when local ATC is offline
