# Annex B | Concorde Procedures

Due to the unique nature of Concorde operations, separation procedures and phraseology can be abbreviated to take advantage of the relative lack of conflicting traffic.

## 1.1 Concorde Separation Standards

### 1.1.1 Vertical Separation - Concorde Cruise Climb

There are no changes to standard vertical separation minima. Concorde aircraft undertake a ‘cruise climb’ at supersonic speeds. As fuel is burnt, Concorde aircraft are able to climb slowly as they become lighter, whilst maintaining a constant speed. This equates to a constant climb rate of approximately 50 feet per minute.

All Concorde aircraft cruise climb from FL470-FL600 in the NAT HLA, therefore standard oceanic clearances for Concorde do not re-state this. This standard cruise climb is separated from all traffic operating at and below FL430.

In the unlikely event that another, non-Concorde aircraft is transiting the OCA above FL430 on a conflicting route, it may be necessary to assign specific levels for cruise climb in the oceanic clearance to Concorde to ensure separation. Cruise climbing from FL490-600 is normally achievable, which ensures separation from traffic operating at and below FL450.

> **Note:** As the level clearance is a cruise climb, not a level block, lower levels will become progressively available to other traffic as the Concorde transits the OCA.

### 1.1.2 Lateral Separation - Concorde Tracks

Four legacy tracks are utilised for the purpose of Concorde flights. Concorde tracks are named NAT SM, NAT SN, NAT SO & NAT SP.

- **SM:** “Sierra Mike” for westbound flight only
- **SN:** “Sierra November” for eastbound flight only
- **SO:** “Sierra Oscar” overflow of supersonic traffic, as coordinated/cleared by ATC.
- **SP:** “Sierra Papa” bi-directional route to Caribbean

These tracks route via intermediate latitudes (i.e. degrees and minutes). For this reason, points on track are commonly abbreviated to the track name and their longitude.

For example, Track SM is defined as the following points (with abbreviated names):

- 50° 41'N 15°W “Sierra Mike 15 West”
- 50° 50'N 20°W “Sierra Mike 20 West” etc.

### 1.1.3 Longitudinal Separation

Apply standard longitudinal separation minima for ‘other aircraft’ (non-ADS-B equipped). 

All Concorde aircraft operate a standard speed schedule on transatlantic routes, cruise climbing at approximately M2.00, meaningful deviation from this speed is not possible. Only Concorde aircraft operate on these tracks at the standard level block so it is not necessary to specify an assigned speed (Mach number) in the oceanic clearance.
### 1.1.4 London Heathrow (EGLL) Departures

Oceanic clearance for Concorde aircraft departing London Heathrow (EGLL) on the standard oceanic Concorde tracks is coordinated by the controller covering the Heathrow Delivery function (when online). The Heathrow controller will pass the time estimate for 15W to the Shanwick Delivery controller (normally via text), who will pass back any time restrictions for 15W.

If any delays occur whilst airborne, it is possible that the Concorde will not be able to reach its destination. This coordination method allows delays to be absorbed on the ground. Heathrow will manage the departure to ensure the aircraft can achieve any time restriction at 15W.

| EGGX_DEL      | BAW1, Track SM, [no restrictions] / [cross 15W not before time 1119] / [cross 15W no later than time 1116] |

> **Note:** It is advised that Shanwick does not pass a “no later than” time restriction to Heathrow, unless this time is at least 5 minutes after the original 15W estimate. This is to minimize the chance of unanticipated ground delays resulting in an airborne conflict.

> **Note:** Concorde aircraft that have been coordinated by Heathrow have received an oceanic clearance and are not required to obtain an oceanic clearance directly from Shanwick. The first direct contact with Shanwick will be at 15W for a position report.

### 1.2 Concorde Phraseology

#### 1.2.1 Oceanic Clearance

**General Notes**

- All Concorde aircraft entering the OCA require an oceanic clearance. Due to the standard speed profile and level block, only longitudinal separation against other Concorde aircraft needs to be considered. The Concorde phraseology is therefore succinct.
- The levels for a cruise climb are not normally stated. If required to ensure separation against other high-level traffic, append the cruise climb levels to the clearance example using the phraseology: “…cruise climb FL490-600”.
- Concorde aircraft departing London Heathrow (EGLL) whose time estimate for 15W has been coordinated with Heathrow delivery are not required to contact Shanwick directly for an oceanic clearance.

#### 1.2.2 Position Reports

**General Notes**

- Position reports should be made at oceanic entry and exit points and at 20W, 30W, 40W, 50W, and 60W.
- At 20W, 40W, and 60W only position and time is required.
- Flight Levels should be provided to the nearest 100ft e.g. FL554.
