## Filtering the Table
natTrak has a large variety of filtering options which you can use in order to ensure you only see clearances which you have the ability to check and reissue a clearance as needed. Filtering can be achieved by either selecting the ```Track``` or the ```Target OCA```.

## Table structure
The Table will show

* Callsign - CS
* Destination - DEST
* Route - Track or RR
* FL - requested FL
* Entry Fix - entry fix
* Entry Time - entry ETA
* Request Time - Time OCA Clearance was requested
* Target - Target OCA selected by Pilot
* View - View Clearance Request
* Delete - dismiss the clearance. Only use if you cannot issue it via natTrak or if it's irrelevant data.
* Auto Acknowledge - Has an Auto Clearance been issued?
