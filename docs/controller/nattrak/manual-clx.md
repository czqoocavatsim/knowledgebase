![natTrak Clearance Request](/controller/img/nattrakmanualclr.png)

Pilots who are within 15 minutes from their Entry Point will not be able to request clearance via the natTrak website. These pilots will need to request clearance via voice.

> **NOTE:** You must issue clearances via the natTrak website, as well as via voice when a pilot is unable to request themselves. This will ensure that the Conflict Detection Tool can detect any conflicts.

The table needs to be filled out in the following format.

* Callsign - The Aircraft Callsign
* Destination - ICAO of the Arrival Field
* Flight Level - Requested Level ```(Formatted as 360)```
* Mach - Requested Mach ```(Formatted as 081)```
* Track or RR - The requested route for the pilot
* Entry Fix - Oceanic OCA Entry Point
* Entry Fix Arrival - ETA for Entry Fix
* TMI - TMI of the day (at top of page)

> Note: The conflict detection tool will appear below the Metadata option, once enough details have been populated.
