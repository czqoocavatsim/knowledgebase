<h2>BUGS AND WIP ITEMS</h2>
<p>Some things are still WIP. View a list here: https://ganderoceanic.com/training-system-support</p>
<h2>Accessing the new system</h2>
<p>To access the training administration system, go to myCZQO and click on the <strong>Instructing </strong>tab, or alternatively, the Dashboard button in the Staff tab.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:63.79%;"><img src="/img/untitled.png"></figure>
<h2>Dashboard</h2>
<p>The first page you will see upon entering the system is the Training Dashboard. This provides an overview of students ready for pick up and things assigned to you. If you're a Senior Staff member, it will also show pending applications.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:63.05%;"><img src="/img/untitled_2.png"></figure>
<p>The sidebar on the left is a central navigation point for the system. The contents of it will change depending on your level of access. For example, people who are not Instructors or Assessors will not see “Your Students” and similar tabs.</p>
<h1>Primary Pages</h1>
<h2>Students</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/img/untitled_3.png"></figure>
<p>This page allows you to view all current and past students. For current students, their date of addition and status labels will appear. The Chief Instructor can also add a student or send a message to all students from this page via the links at the bottom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Instructors</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/img/untitled_4.png"></figure>
<p>This page allows you to view all current Instructors and Assessors. It shows you the number of students assigned to them. As with students, the CI can add Instructors and send a message to all Instructors from here.</p>
<p><i>This page does not show people who have previously been Instructors but are not currently. To access these Instructors, enter the following URL: /admin/training/instructing/instructors/CID</i></p>
<h2>Calendar</h2>
<p><i>To be added</i></p>
<h2>Board</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/img/untitled_5.png"></figure>
<p>This page replicates what we currently have on Trello and allows for a full view of where students are assigned to. It lists students under the Not Ready, Ready For Pick-Up, Solo Cert, and Ready for Assessment labels in seperate lists, and then shows lists for each Instructor showing their assigned students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add a list to the Board, a new Student Status Label needs to be created.</p>
<h2>Training/OTS Sessions</h2>
<p><i>To be added</i></p>
<h2>Your Students</h2>
<p>(add)</p>
<h1>Through the training process</h1>
<h2>Student profiles</h2>
<p>To pick up a student marked as Ready for Pick-Up, access their profile via the Dashboard, the Board, or the Students page.</p>
<p>You will be presented with their profile.</p>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/img/untitled_6.png"></figure>
<h4>Information</h4>
<p>Here you can find their contact details. This information is only shown if you are a Senior Staff member or the Instructor assigned to the student for privacy reasons.</p>
<h4>Availability</h4>
<p>Before a student is marked Ready For Pick-Up, they must submit their availability for training via myCZQO's Training Portal. They are notified of this when their application is accepted. (Marked in red)</p>
<h4>Instructor</h4>
<p>Here, you can view the instructor assigned to the student and assign you or another person as their Instructor.</p>
<h2>Pick up the student</h2>
<p>To pick up the student, click the <strong>Assign </strong>button in the Instructor panel. You will be presented with a dialog asking you to pick the Instructor you wish to assign. Choose yourself in the select box. Then click Assign. It will sent you an email confirmation and the student will now be assigned to you. You should also then be able to view their contact details.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:57.63%;"><img src="/img/untitled_7.png"></figure>
<p>The student will now appear as assigned to you, and has they have been picked up, they will be assigned the In Progress label. You may now continue organising sessions with them via email or Discord as normal. In the future, you will be able to organise sessions through the website.</p>
<figure class="image image_resized" style="width:57.38%;"><img src="/img/untitled_8.png"></figure>
<h2>Training sessions</h2>
<p>Coming soon. For now, continue as we have before and create <strong>Training Notes to document sessions.</strong></p>
<h2>Training notes</h2>
<p>As their assigned Instructor, you can create Training Notes for your student documenting their process. Access their notes via the student profile.</p>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/img/untitled_9.png"></figure>
<p>You can view the notes created previously for this Student. View them by clicking the View button on each. You can add a note by clicking the Add Note button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below them, you can also view Recommendations given by Instructors for the student in the past. These include recommendations for OTS and Solo Certs.</p>
<p>Training notes can be viewable by students (recommended) or limited to staff only.</p>
<h2>Status labels</h2>
<p>Students can be assigned status labels to show their current stage of training.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Not Ready - student has been accepted, still hasn't submitted their availability</li>
  <li>Ready For Pick-Up - student has submitted their times, or the student has not got an assigned instructor</li>
  <li>In Progress - student is assigned and training is underway</li>
  <li>Solo Certification - student has an active solo certification (assigned in conjunction with In Progress)</li>
  <li>Ready For Assessment - student is recommended by Instructor for assessment (assigned without In Progress)</li>
  <li>Completed - student has passed assessment and has completed training</li>
  <li>Inactive - student should be placed for removal</li>
</ul>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right image_resized" style="width:50.28%;"><img src="/img/untitled_10.png"></figure>
<p>To assign a label, click the plus icon next to their status labels on their profile. You will be presented with a dialog asking you to pick the label.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To remove a label, hover over the label until you get a red mark next to it. Click the label to remove it. You cannot remove a label if it is the only one assigned to the student.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<figure class="image image-style-align-right"><img src="/img/untitled_11.png"></figure>
<p>You can recommend your student be given a Solo Certification and be sent for assessment. These buttons are visible on their student profile. To issue a recommendation, click the respective button. It will send an email notification to all Assessors with your recommendation. They will communicate with you their course of action. These buttons will be greyed out if the student is already on a solo cert or is marked ready for assessment, respectively.</p>
<h2>Finishing their training</h2>
<p>When an Assessor has marked a student as having passed their OTS, they will need to create a training note with their assessment report. Eventually, this will be done through marking their OTS Session as Passed.</p>
